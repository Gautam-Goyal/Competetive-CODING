There are two sisters Alice and Betty. You have 𝑛 candies. You want to distribute these 𝑛 candies between two sisters in such a way that:
Alice will get 𝑎 (𝑎>0) candies;Betty will get 𝑏 (𝑏>0) candies;each sister will get some integer number of candies;
Alice will get a greater amount of candies than Betty (i.e. 𝑎>𝑏);all the candies will be given to one of two sisters (i.e. 𝑎+𝑏=𝑛).
Your task is to calculate the number of ways to distribute exactly 𝑛 candies between sisters in a way described above. Candies are 
indistinguishable.Formally, find the number of ways to represent 𝑛 as the sum of 𝑛=𝑎+𝑏, where and 𝑏 are positive integers and 𝑎>𝑏.
You have to answer 𝑡 independent test cases.

Input
The first line of the input contains one integer 𝑡(1≤𝑡≤10^4)— the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.
The only line of a test case contains one integer 𝑛 (1≤𝑛≤2.10^9).— the number of candies you have.

Output

For each test case, print the answer — the number of ways to distribute exactly 𝑛 candies between two sisters in a way described
in the problem statement. If there is no way to satisfy all the conditions, print 0.

Note

For the test case of the example, the 3 possible ways to distribute candies are:
𝑎=6, 𝑏=1;
𝑎=5, 𝑏=2;
𝑎=4, 𝑏=3.
