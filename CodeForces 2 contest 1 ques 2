You are given three positive integers 𝑛,𝑎 and 𝑏. You have to construct a string 𝑠 of length 𝑛 consisting of lowercase Latin letters such
that each substring of length 𝑎 has exactly 𝑏 distinct letters. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.
You have to answer 𝑡 independent test cases.Recall that the substring 𝑠[𝑙…𝑟] is the string 𝑠𝑙,𝑠𝑙+1,…,𝑠𝑟 and its length is 𝑟−𝑙+1.
In this problem you are only interested in substrings of length 𝑎.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer 𝑡(1≤𝑡≤2000) — the number of test cases. Then 𝑡 test cases follow.The only line of a
test case contains three space-separated integers 𝑛, 𝑎 and 𝑏 (1≤𝑎≤𝑛≤2000,1≤𝑏≤min(26,𝑎), where 𝑛 is the length of the required string, 
𝑎 is the length of a substring and 𝑏 is the required number of distinct letters in each substring of length 𝑎.
It is guaranteed that the sum of 𝑛 over all test cases does not exceed 2000 (∑𝑛≤2000).

Output

For each test case, print the answer — such a string 𝑠 of length 𝑛 consisting of lowercase Latin letters that each substring of length
𝑎 has exactly 𝑏 distinct letters. If there are multiple valid answers, print any of them. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.



Example

input
4
7 5 3
6 1 1
6 6 1
5 2 2

output
tleelte
qwerty
vvvvvv
abcde





Note

In the first test case of the example, consider all the substrings of length 5:

"tleel": it contains 3 distinct (unique) letters,
"leelt": it contains 3 distinct (unique) letters,
"eelte": it contains 3distinct (unique) letters.
